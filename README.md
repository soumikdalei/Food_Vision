# üçî Food Vision

Food Vision is a deep learning project for classifying images of food using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning.  
It demonstrates image preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.

## üìå Overview

The project applies modern computer vision techniques to recognize food categories from images.  
It includes both a **Jupyter/Colab notebook pdf** for step-by-step experimentation and **Python scripts** for modular reusability.
